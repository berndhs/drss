Building from Source Code
=========================

This program requires the Qt4 toolset. If you don't have Qt, you can 
get it from 

     http://qt.nokia.com
     
Qt4 is available for many platforms.

Building
--------

There should be a file named "build.sh". This is a shell script that tries
to guess if you have the right version of Qt, and if so build the drss program.

Execute build.sh with the command:

$ sh build.sh


It will try to compile things for you.
At the end it will tell you whether this worked or not.
If it worked, you will have an executable file
called "drss". Copy (or move) this file where you
keep your executables.
